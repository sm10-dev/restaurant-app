# restaurant-app

We are proposing the development of a restaurant order-taking and management app using ReactJS, Spring Boot, and MySQL. The app will consist of two main views: 
1. Customer view: Allows customers to browse the menu, customize orders, track order status, and provide feedback.
2. Administrator view: Manages the menu, tracks fulfilled orders, and views dish availability.

Additional features will include an Analytics Dashboard for tracking popular dishes and their ratings from internet.
